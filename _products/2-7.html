shortdescription: "The OpenROV v2.7 is the best ROV we've ever built. It streams HD video back to a surface laptop over an ultra-thin two-wire tether. It maneuvers using the same thruster configuration as previous models, however new hydrodynamic adjustments, new motors, and new motor speed controllers have resulted in greatly improved handling and control, especially in the vertical direction. A new LED board provides even more illumination in the depths, and the lasers provide both scaling and distance measurement capability."

          The OpenROV v2.7 comes as a kit (we also sell assembled versions) and requires a greatly reduced amount of soldering and electronics experience. It is simple enough that a beginner or novice could build the device as a weekend project.
